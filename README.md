# Towards Comprehensive Detection of Chinese Harmful Memes: Dataset and Detector
Harmful memes have proliferated on the Chinese Internet, while research on detecting Chinese harmful memes significantly lags behind due to the absence of reliable datasets and effective detectors.
To this end, we present the comprehensive detection of Chinese harmful memes.
We introduce **ToxiCN MM**, the first Chinese harmful meme dataset, which consists of 12,000 samples with fine-grained annotations for meme types. 
Additionally, we propose a baseline detector, Multimodal Harmful Knowledge Enhancement (MHKE), designed to incorporate contextual information from meme content, thereby enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese memes.
In the evaluation phase, we conduct extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses on multiple baselines, including LLMs and our MHKE. 
Experimental results indicate that detecting Chinese harmful memes is challenging for existing models, while demonstrating the effectiveness of MHKE.
